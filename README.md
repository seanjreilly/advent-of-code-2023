# advent-of-code-2023

Welcome to my [Advent of Code][aoc] [^aoc] solutions for 2023. If you want to see how I did any of it, please feel free.

I'm doing all of the coding using [Kotlin][kotlin], so I used the JetBrains [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] as a starting point.
I used test-driven development because I always do (although it's a fun spare-time christmas project so I may have skimped on coverage).

Unit tests are powered by [Junit](https://junit.org/junit5/), and I also used the excellent [Kotlin Power Assert plugin](https://github.com/bnorm/kotlin-power-assert) by [Brian Norman](https://github.com/bnorm) for assertions and JetBrains IntelliJ as my IDE.

[^aoc]:
Advent of Code is an annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
